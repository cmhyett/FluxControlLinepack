scenario 1: nominal operation

scenario 2: reduced supply, normal consumption and exports. Supply proportions between 1 & 8 are nominal, but we are short about 15% on average (not constant)

scenario 3: nominal operation until hour 48, where we lose supply 1, we then see how long we can operate in emergency regime, (curtailing exports)

scenario 4: same as scenario 3, but we lose supply 8 instead of 1

scenario 5: scenario 3, but in addition to curtailing exports, we also set node 8 to 78bar

scenario 6: scenario 4, but in addition to curtailing exports, we also set node 1 to 78 bar
